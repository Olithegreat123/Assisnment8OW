c: This program is supposed to be able to calculate any number you type into the A and B space vy using the hypotenuse equationand out put the number to C square.

e: When opening up the program, you will notice that the winow is a little messed up when first opening up. You will have to adjust it yourself maually.I tried fixing it in the scene builder but I couldnt figure it out no matter how much I adjusted the V box and the Pane. Also the red error code, I couldnt figure out how to make it spawn when the user does input a integer.
